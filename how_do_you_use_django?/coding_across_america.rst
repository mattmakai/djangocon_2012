Coding Across America
=====================

I've been developing with Python/Django since the beginning of 2008, at
first on the side and then later full-time for several clients as a consultant.
At the beginning of 2012, I decided I needed to get away from Washington, DC
for awhile and see how companies in the rest of the country use technology
in general and Python/Django more specifically.

So I began planning [Coding Across America](http://www.codingacrossamerica.com/about.html), which begins in March 2013. I'll be driving 9000 miles across
the United States from March 2013 to August 2013, meeting with start ups,
going to user group meetings, attending conferences, and programming in coffee
shops in about 25 different cities.

I'd love to expand my list of Python/Django (and other similar technology) 
companies to visit. And more specifically, I'd love to talk to Daily Dot when
I'm in Austin to find out more about how you guys use technology to accomplish
your goal of writing about Internet communities.
